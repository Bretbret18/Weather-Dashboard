# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard app that allows the user to search for weather conditions
by city. A search for a certain city will result in both the current weather conditions there as well as the 5 day forcast. Each search is then saved in a list so that the user can easily check on different locations by a simple click of a button. This app uses API calls to 'api.openweathermap.org' to obtain the weather information.
